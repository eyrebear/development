            <h1>Fraggle Rockin' Geckos</h1>
          <p class="par"> Crested geckos make great and easy pets.  They prefer "room temperatures" between 68 and 78 degrees.
                Do you love smoothies? -- These little geckos do too!  There are many affordable flavors and well-balanced 
                powder diets available commercially for your little friend - just add water! youngsters especially love bugs 
                once or twice a week, and small crikets can be picked up at your local reptile store for less than a dollar.
          </p>

              <p class="par">  Crested geckos are easy to handle, but take care not to startle them or grab them by the tail, as they 
                    have special muscles and bones that allow them to detatch their tail as a prey response, and this 
                    species does not grow them back.  Don't worry if this happens though, your gecko is still perfectly healthy 
                    and lovingly referred to as a "frog butt," which is fitting considering hopping around is their preferred
                    mode of transportation.
